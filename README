shareclip - simple clipboard sharing using python
this will basically dump your clipboard into a file
that a client computer can read

To make it work:
1. You'll need Python 2.7 (I don't have it working for 3.0 and higher)
2. Put this code anywhere on the two computers you want to exchange clipboard data with.
3. Run the script on both the client and server computers

I'm still trying to get it to work.
